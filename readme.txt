All-in-one Facebook Like Widget. Lets you quickly add a Like Button, activity stream and/or a Fanbox to your WordPress site (as a widget).

== Description ==

*Based on `HC Facebook Like Widget` which seems not to be maintained anymore.*

If you are looking for a quick and simple way to display a Facebook Like box, this is your plugin!

**You choose to display..:**
 * ..just a simple box with Facebook Like button and profile picture
 * ..a like button + timeline stream (offcourse with a Like button and profile picture)
 * ..a like button + list of your fans or friends (also with a Like button and profile picture)

All you have to do is install this plugin, drag the widget to where you want to display it, configure it in the widget admin screen and that's about it!
Now your visitors can like your Facebook page straight from your website.

When you add the widget, you need to input your Facebook ID. This ID helps the widget to display the correct page.
